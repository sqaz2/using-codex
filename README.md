# PersonaGraph

PersonaGraph is a concept social network inspired by Facebook and LinkedIn that adapts itself around the interests and personality preferences you select. The prototype lives entirely in static HTML/CSS/JS so it can be opened directly in a browser.

## Features

- Curated feed that recombines longform stories, opportunities, and rituals from chosen interest areas.
- Sidebars that surface suggested introductions, projects, and learning tracks matched to your interests.
- Momentum planner that turns interests into quick actions and energy boosts.
- Personality resonance hub that adjusts collaboration tips and conversation starters for INFJ, ENTP, INTJ, and ENFP profiles.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser. No build step or backend is required.
2. Choose the interests that align with what you want to explore to refresh the feed and supporting cards.
3. Switch personality lenses to see how the tone and interaction tips adapt for each type.

Because everything is client-side, you can deploy the folder on any static hosting platform or continue iterating locally by editing the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.
